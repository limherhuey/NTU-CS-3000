# CZ3xxx Modules

This repository contains my solutions to the level 3000 computer science modules in NTU involving any code.

I would like to emphasise that the best way to learn is to do it yourself. Please write your own implementation before looking at other people's code, and of course, abide by the university's academic integrity policy.

With that said, let's dive right in! More details are provided in the README files within each of the modules' directories.
